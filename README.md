Yii2 Swagger Viewer Module
=========================

Viewer of a separate yaml/json swagger docs. Include swagger multi-doc merger, so you can format your docs in multiple files for faster edits.

This package is based on our SwaggerTools pack.

Example of docs to view can be found here:
[SwaggerTools docs example](https://github.com/justcoded/swagger-tools/tree/master/examples/v2.0)

As extra feature, you can provide additional properties to generate enums, which are usually 
used by mock servers to generate test responses.
We recommend [Prism](https://stoplight.io/platform/prism/) mock server. If you specify correct 
validation rules (like minimum, maximum, minItems, maxItems, etc.) it will generate nice mocks
with data generated by faker php lib.
